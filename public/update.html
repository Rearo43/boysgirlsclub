    <h3>Weekly Updates</h3>
    <h4>Week 1: Languages of Code</h4>
    <p>
        Last week was a great start to the summer. Campers showed a great deal of interest as we began learning primarily HTML, CSS and a little bit of JavaScript. It was really exciting to see the pages each camper came up with using CodePen (a coding playground). </br> I encourage you to ask your camper to log into their personal accounts at home to share their master pieces!! </br> Below are links to CodePens that I've made as Language "Cheat Sheets". These will be extremely valuable for those campers who would like to continue coding at home. 
    </p>
     <a class="link" href="https://codepen.io/rearo43/pen/eYvazvG">HTML</a>,
      <a class="link" href="https://codepen.io/rearo43/pen/qBrzqgj">CSS</a>,
       <a class="link" href="">JavaScript (to be updated)</a>
       <li>
           Another great and easy resource to learn almost anything you can think of is 
           <a class="link" href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">W3Schools</a>.
            Use google and search "How to hover W3Schools" or "How to <strong>ANYTHING</strong> W3Schools" to get quick examples and information, easily formatted for beginning coders.
        </li>
    <p>
        Lastly, at the request of the majority of our campers I've decided to incorporate coding lessons intermittently throughout the next 8 weeks. As many of you may know the beginning lessons of code can lack excitement but once you get into CSS (stylings and coloring the app) and Javascript (moving parts of the app like buttons, questions, moving elements, etc.), app building becomes much more fun. We were able to hit that point part way through the week and your extremely smart campers are eager to dive deeper into all the capabilities of code!!
