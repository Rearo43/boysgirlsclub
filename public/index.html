    <h4>Week 1: Languages of Code</h4>
    <p>
        Last week was a great start to the summer. Your kids showed a lot of interest while learning primarily HTML, CSS and a little bit of JavaScript. It was really exciting to see the pages each camper came up with using Codepen (a coding playground). I encourage you to ask your student to log into their personal accounts at home to see their master pieces!! </br> Below are I've put some links to my some of my personal codepens I've put together at Language "Cheat Sheets"
    </p>
     <a href="https://codepen.io/rearo43/pen/eYvazvG">HTML</a>
      <a href="https://codepen.io/rearo43/pen/qBrzqgj">CSS</a>
       <a href="">JavaScript (to be updated)</a>
       <li>
           Another great and easy resource to learn almost anything you can think of is 
           <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">W3Schools</a>.
            Use google and search "How to hover" W3Schools or How to ANYTHING W3School to get quick examples and information easily formatted for beginner coders.
        </li>
    <p>
        At the request of the majority of our campers I've decided to incorporate coding lessons intermittently throughout the next 8 weeks. As many of you may know the beginning lessons of code can lack excitement but once you get into CSS (stylings and coloring the app) and Javascript (moving parts of the app like buttons, questions, moving elements, etc.) app building becomes much more fun. We were able to hit that point part way through the week and your extremely smart kids are eager to continue to dive deeper into all the capabilities of code!!
